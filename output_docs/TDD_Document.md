# Technical Design Document: Iterative Factorial Calculation

## Summary

This document details the design for a system that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using an iterative approach. The system consists of a single module with a primary function for factorial calculation and includes usage examples.

## Components

*   Factorial Calculation Module

## Sequence of Steps

1.  Input: The system receives a non-negative integer 'n' as input.
2.  Validation: The system implicitly validates that 'n' is a non-negative integer (although explicit validation is not implemented in the current code).
3.  Iteration: The system iteratively calculates the factorial of 'n' by multiplying numbers from 1 up to 'n'.
4.  Output: The system returns the calculated factorial as an integer.

## Constraints

*   Input 'n' should be a non-negative integer. The behavior for negative integers is undefined.
*   The factorial function may result in integer overflow for large values of 'n'. This implementation does not include overflow handling.
*   The system is designed for single-threaded operation. Concurrent access is not tested and may lead to unexpected results.

## Assumptions

*   The input 'n' is within the range of representable integers to avoid overflow issues.
*   The system runs in an environment with sufficient memory to store the intermediate and final factorial values.
*   Basic arithmetic operations (multiplication) are reliable and available.
